The games that use artificial intelligence have created an
alternative design category named as player versus computer (PVC).
The games that are designed as PVC consist of at least one hu
man player and one artificial intelligence algorithm. For instance,
the game of chess is a solid example to PVC game design. One of
the most efficient designs for the artificial intelligence algorithm cre
ated for playing chess is by considering all the possible steps to de
cide the best outcome by minimizing the gain of the opponent and
maximizing the chance of success in a certain situation during the
game. This algorithm is called MiniMax algorithm.
